Hi, I'm Michael Tran 👋

## DevOps Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure Architect | Healthcare Technology Specialist

With over 10 years of experience designing and automating cloud-native infrastructure across **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**, I specialize in building secure, scalable, and compliant systems for mission-critical healthcare applications. My expertise spans Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes orchestration, CI/CD automation, and MLOps pipelines—all with a focus on **HIPAA**, **SOC 2**, and **FDA 21 CFR Part 11** compliance.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Design multi-cloud environments with 99.99% uptime using Terraform, Pulumi, and Ansible
- **Container Orchestration**: Build production-grade Kubernetes platforms (EKS, GKE, AKS)
- **CI/CD Automation**: Develop end-to-end pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD
- **Healthcare Data**: Implement secure pipelines for FHIR/HL7 and DICOM workflows with full PHI protection
- **MLOps & AI**: Deploy GPU-accelerated AI workloads for medical imaging and clinical NLP
- **Security & Compliance**: Ensure regulatory compliance through automated scanning and encryption
